Hey Tia! Let's make a project together :)
Sure Kev :D


## Description
I am looking into extracting data from an api to manipulate and display on a website to get some
customers for our shared business. I will place the data I get from the api into a csv for you to 
manipulate the data the way we want so the customer will buy the items we am selling. We want
to show how our item (still thinking of what we can sell, maybe chicken lo mein...?) is cheaper
while still tasting good!

Let's also show how you manipulated the data to our coding friends and to jobs that want to hire
you so you can show off to them!

Also between you and me, We gotta get some money from this side hustle to take a trip together to China 
so you can show me your favorite spots ;)


## Resources
This is a machine learning course from Kaggle that I think would be good for you
to learn for this project to display the models! I would start with looking the
intro course first:
- https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning

and if needed, we can look into the others:
- https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning
- https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability

Look into these ways to make graphs. I will work with you to add them to the frontend at the end:
- https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization




## Deliverables (Final result for this project)
- take the csv file and create 3 different graphs (you can pick which you want)
- outline them in a python file so I can use the data
- outline them as well using jupyter notebook (or whatever data tool) to add to github repo


## Bonus (if you have the energy)
I know that the courses have some machine learning stuff, but lets look together at some linkedin
jobs applications and see if theres a new tool we can use to make this cooler and get you
more experiences!


## Extraneous stuff
I will be adding your graphs to the frontend. You can view that by going to your directory and
opening the "index.html" file with a browser, like Google chrome when right clicking on it. 
Since thats the case, we can make the graphs a interesting color scheme!

Let me know if you need help at anytime. I am not a data scientist, but I can learn as much with you
as you need me to as I try to guide you to eventually learn how to research yourself :)
